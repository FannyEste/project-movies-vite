# Movie Site Project


We had to use themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

we also had to follow the design but we were allow to improve as we thought it could be better. 


### The Problem

First problem was to make the API work, I believe that it was necesary for me to wait a bit after the API was generated because sudenly it started working after 20 min trying. 

Second, I had to create an .env for good practice, security and as I saw as a suggestion in our chanel on Slack with one of the students. 

I got a lot of help from this week material and the recording sesions, I had to watch it more than once to have a deeper understanding, and as usual I got a lot of help from chatgpt and stackoverflow.

if I had more time, I would like to try to re do it my self to get a deeper comprehension and review what I did without getting a lot of help from chatgpt.
